## What Is this?
This repo contains some code I am developing, in said code, I have decided it was a good idea to hardcode a bunch of AWS IAM User Secret Access Keys for ease of development. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now that i've accidently posted to this public GitHub Repo insted of to the internal private development repository, I'm having second thoughts. 

## Now that I have realized my mistake, what do I do next?
