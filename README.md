A Public Repository Containing All of My Secret Keys In Plain Text. 

![Key To The City](images/KeyToTheCity.gif)

## What Is this?
This repo contains some code I am developing, in said code, I have decided it was a good idea to hardcode a bunch of AWS IAM User Secret Access Keys for ease of development. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now that i've accidently posted to this public GitHub Repo insted of to the internal private development repository, I'm having second thoughts. 

## I just got an email saying my keys are public.. what do I do next? 
This is where I need your help. Where do I start?
